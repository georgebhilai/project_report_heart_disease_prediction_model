# project_report_heart_disease_prediction_model
The Capstone Project has three files in PDF_Rmd and R and the data files which are uploaded into this repository.
As a part of the course on Data Science we are to choose our own project and use models / algorithms and predict the outcomes based on the dataset. The project, “Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours” has been chosen by me. The project requires coding in R. The project report has been covered under four major heads, viz:
1.	Introduction
2.	Analysis
3.	Results
4.	Conclusion
